## üöÄ About Me

As a highly passionate and experienced software engineer, I have spent over a decade honing my skills in the programming world. My journey began with PHP and has evolved to focus on **Python and Go**. In my current role as a **DevOps Engineer**, I utilize cutting-edge tools such as **Docker, ansible, and Terraform** to manage infrastructure, and have a strong understanding of platforms like **AWS** and GCP.

In addition to my technical expertise, I have a background in marketing and eCommerce, allowing me to integrate technologies such as the **Facebook Conversion API** and create chatbots with ManyChats to drive sales and improve ROI. I am also skilled in creating email and landing page funnels to increase visitor engagement and conversions.

I thrive in team environments and have **excellent interpersonal skills**, making it easy for me to adapt to new teams and projects. With a true love for technology and a hunger for continuous learning, I am excited to tackle any challenge that comes my way as a software engineer.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family and participating in activities such as **padel, karting, and paintball**.
